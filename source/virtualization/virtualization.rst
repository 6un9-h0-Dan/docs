Using pfSense Software in Virtualization Environments
=====================================================

pfSense supports a variety of virtualiztion environments, such as VMware
(vSphere, Fusion or Workstation), Proxmox, VirtualBox, Xen, KVM, Hyper-V
and so on. Some platforms are better suited for testing than production.
Certain platforms also have specific quirks. Check other articles in the
:doc:`/virtualization/index` section or search the forum for specifics.

Set up and install is straightforward and similar to set up on a
physical machine using a full installation from an ISO image.

Currently available guides on pfSense virtualization:

-  :doc:`VMware ESXi </virtualization/virtualizing-pfsense-with-vmware-vsphere-esxi>`
-  :doc:`Hyper-V </virtualization/virtualizing-pfsense-with-hyper-v>`
-  :doc:`Proxmox </virtualization/virtualizing-pfsense-with-proxmox>`
