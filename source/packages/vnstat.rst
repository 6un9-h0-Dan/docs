Vnstat
======

This package combines 3 different ways to display the traffic usage
generated by vnStat (a console-based network traffic monitor).

What is it: vnStat is a network traffic monitor/bandwidth monitoring
tool vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor

What it is not: vnStat isn't a packet sniffer

Current version, vnstat2, works on currently supported releases

Notes
-----

Every NIC is added on install. So if a NIC is added (or removed) on the
pfSense box, remove the package and install again. If pfSense has data
for a NIC vnStat will report the data even if the NIC has been removed.

To clear database for a NIC, delete it from */conf/vnstat*

Update happens every minute. This causes it to write to the storage
media. If using CF card for NanoBSD users, writing to the card every
minute may shorten the life of the card.

FAQ
---

If the following is observed::

  Traffic data for Notice: Undefined index: pppoe0 in /usr/local/www/vnstat2/index.php on line 160 (pppoe0)

Try pressing Shift+f5 on each page to force the browser to refresh, this
error will stay if the interface no longer exists, but since there is
data in the database for this interface, it is reported.

A reinstall of the package will not change this as the core pfSense
system has data pertaining to the non existent data and thus other
packages such as vnstat2 will report the data it has or has found
