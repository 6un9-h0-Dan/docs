Users wishing to extend the functionality of their pfSense installation
may add packages from a selection of software.

Packages provide additional services and utilities not found in the base
system. These are all completely optional and are not necessary for most
deployments.

Management of packages is performed in the :doc:`package manager </packages/package-manager>` found under
**System > Packages** on platforms that are capable of using packages.
