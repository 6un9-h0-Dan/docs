Snort Rules
===========

Rules
-----

Use the **Rules** tab for the interface to configure individual rules in
the enabled categories. Generally this page is only used to disable
particular rules that may be generating too many false positives in a
network environment. Be sure they are in fact truly false positives
before taking the step of disabling a Snort rule!

Select a rules category from the **Category:** drop-down to view all the
assigned rules. Click the |block| icon at the far-left of a
row to toggle the rule's state from either enabled to disabled, or from
disabled to enabled. The icon will change color to indicate the action
taken. At the bottom of the page is a legend showing the four icon
colors used to indicate the current state of a rule.
