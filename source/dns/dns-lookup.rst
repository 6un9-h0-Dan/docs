Performing a DNS Lookup
=======================

The DNS Lookup page at **Diagnostics > DNS Lookup** performs a quick DNS
lookup of a hostname to IP address or vice versa.

Enter a hostname or IP address then click **DNS Lookup**. The results
will be displayed along with the time it took to resolve the host from
each configured DNS server.

Links are also provided for IP WHOIS and IP info provided by external
sites such as `DNS Stuff <http://dnsstuff.com>`__. Links are also
present to perform a ping or traceroute to the entered site using the
tools in the pfSense GUI.
