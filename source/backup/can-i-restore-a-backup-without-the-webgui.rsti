Can I restore a backup without the WebGUI
=========================================

Yes, among other methods, the configuration can be `automatically
restored during the installation process using a USB
drive <Automatically_Restore_During_Install>`__.

For embedded installs, the CF/media can be mounted in another system
that can read/write UFS2 filesystems and copy the *config.xml* by hand
to */cf/conf/config.xml*
