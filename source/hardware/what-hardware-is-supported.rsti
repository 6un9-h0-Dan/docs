What hardware is supported
==========================

At a minimum, everything supported by the FreeBSD version used by the
installed pfSense version is supported.

See the table at `Versions of pfSense and
FreeBSD <Versions_of_pfSense_and_FreeBSD>`__ to find the FreeBSD version
which corresponds to a given release, and links to hardware support for
each version may be found in that table on the **FreeBSD Release**
column.
