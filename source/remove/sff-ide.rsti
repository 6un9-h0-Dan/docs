SFF IDE
=======

SFF IDE stands for Small Form Factor IDE (2.5"). SFF IDE drives are more
commonly referred to as "laptop hard drives" as they are used in
virtually all modern laptops that use IDE/SATA drives, but their small
size and low power consumption also makes them well suited for embedded
hardware common to firewall installations.
