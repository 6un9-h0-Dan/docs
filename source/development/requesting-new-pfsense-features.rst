Requesting New pfSense Features
===============================

There are several ways to influence the development of pfSense.

#. Write the functionality and submit a merge request on
   `github <https://github.com/pfsense>`__
#. Start a `bounty on the
   forum <https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?board=34.0>`__
#. `Support customers <https://portal.pfsense.org>`__ may submit tickets
   with feature requests. Though we cannot promise any specific request
   will be fulfilled, requests from customers receive more attention
   from the developers
#. Submit a feature request at https://redmine.pfsense.org
