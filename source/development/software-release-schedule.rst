Software Release Schedule
=========================

Releases are made when they are ready. A public schedule is not
available at this time, but announcements are made on
https://blog.pfsense.org/ when a release nears for development
milestones such as Release Candidates.

We provide maintenance releases as needed, typically a couple per year.
These include only bug fixes and security updates. We release a new
version with new features roughly every 18 months, with work currently
under way on 2.3 release.
