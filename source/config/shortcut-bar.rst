Shortcut Bar
============

The **Shortcut Bar** offers quick navigation to pages related to the one
being viewed, to save having to hunt down pages in various menus when
performing configuration or troubleshooting.

The shortcut bar appears at the top right of a page, and the icons vary
depending on what options are available in the current area.
