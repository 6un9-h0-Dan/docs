Why does autoupdate report a new version on the newest snapshot?
================================================================

When installing from a snapshot, and then immediately checking for
updates, the timestamps will be slightly different because the update
files are built just after the ISO image. Once updated to a new firmware
using the auto update function, then it will properly compare the two.
