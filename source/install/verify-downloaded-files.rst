Verifying Downloaded Files
==========================

When downloading files from the pfSense web site, SHA256 checksum files
are available.

These SHA256 files can be used to verify the download completed
successfully, and that an official release is being used.

Hash verification on Windows
----------------------------

Windows users may install
`HashTab <http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/>`__ or a similar
program to view file hashes. With HashTab installed, right click on the
downloaded file and a **File Hashes** tab is available containing the
SHA256 hash, among others. The generated SHA256 hash can be compared
with the contents of the *.sha256* file downloaded from the pfSense
website, which is viewable in any plain text editor such as Notepad. If
a SHA256 hash is not displayed, right click in the hash view and click
**Settings**, then check the box for **SHA256** and click **OK**.

Hash verification on BSD and Linux
----------------------------------

The *sha256* command comes standard on FreeBSD, and many other UNIX and
UNIX-like operating systems. GNU or Linux systems provide a *sha256sum*
command that works similarly. A SHA256 hash may be generated by running
the following command from within the directory containing the
downloaded file::

  # sha256 pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-p3-amd64.iso.gz

Compare the resulting hash with the contents of the *.sha256* file
downloaded from the pfSense website.

Hash verification on OS X
-------------------------

OS X includes the *shasum* command, which can calculate sha256 using *shasum
-a 256 <filename>*, but there are also GUI applications available such as
`HashTab <http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/>`_.
