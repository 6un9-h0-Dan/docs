Verifying Downloaded Files
==========================

When downloading files from the `pfSense website`_, SHA256 checksum files are
available.

These SHA256 files can be used to verify the download completed successfully,
and that an official release is being used.

Hash verification on Windows
----------------------------

Windows users may install `HashTab`_ or a similar program to view file hashes.
With HashTab installed, right click on the downloaded file to access the **File
Hashes** tab containing the SHA256 hash, among others.

.. note:: If a SHA256 hash is not displayed, right click in the hash view and
   click **Settings**, then check the box for **SHA256** and click **OK**.

The generated SHA256 hash can be compared with the contents of the **.sha256**
file downloaded from the `pfSense website`_, which is viewable in any plain text
editor such as Notepad.

Hash verification on BSD and Linux
----------------------------------

The ``sha256`` command comes standard on FreeBSD, and many other UNIX and
UNIX-like operating systems. GNU or Linux systems provide a ``sha256sum``
command that works similarly. A SHA256 hash may be generated by running
the following command from within the directory containing the downloaded
file:

.. code-block:: console

   sha256 pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-p3-amd64.iso.gz

Compare the resulting hash with the contents of the **.sha256** file downloaded
from the `pfSense website`_.

Hash verification on OS X
-------------------------

OS X includes the ``shasum`` command, which can calculate sha256 using:

.. code-block:: console

   shasum -a 256 pfSense-CE-2.4.4-RELEASE-p3-amd64.iso.gz

There are also GUI applications available such as `HashTab`_.
