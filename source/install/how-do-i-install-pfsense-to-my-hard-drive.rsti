How do I install pfSense to my hard drive
=========================================

There is a short prompt early in the boot process at which *I* may be
pressed to invoke the installer early without booting the rest of the
way, or if left without input, the installer will be started
automatically.

See :doc:`Installing pfSense </install/installing-pfsense>` for more details.
