Captive Portal
**************

Captive Portal in pfSense forces users on an interface to authenticate before
granting access to the Internet. Where possible, the firewall automatically
presents a login web page which the user must use to enter credentials such as a
username/password or a voucher code. This feature is commonly used throughout
the hospitality industry (Hotels, restaurants, airports, and more) as well as in
corporate and even home environments.
