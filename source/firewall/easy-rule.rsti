Easy Rule
=========

The Easy Rule system makes it easy to add firewall rules when viewing
the output of the firewall logs (**Status > System Logs**, **Firewall**
Tab).

The **Easy Rule** page in the GUI will only display a confirmation or
error output when rules could not be added.

See `Firewall Logs <Firewall_Logs>`__ and `Adding Rules With
easyrule <Adding_Rules_With_easyrule>`__ for more details on using Easy
Rule.
